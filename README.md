The core of the project is a notebook organized by thematic sections.

# The project 
Imagine working for a supermarket chain committed to promoting a sustainable and responsible lifestyle.

These supermarkets are not just places to shop but also points of reference for those seeking organic, sustainable, and eco-friendly products.

The company stands out for its commitment to sustainability in various areas. First and foremost, it offers a wide range of sustainable food products, sourced from organic farming, low environmental impact livestock, and suppliers who comply with ethical and environmental standards


Dataset Access is provided to a dataset containing the company's sales data, with the aim of analyzing it to identify which cities potentially generate the most revenue, which product categories offer the highest value, and whether the buyer's gender influences purchasing behavior. A machine learning model will be developed to predict the expected profitability of individual purchases.

A vertical analysis will be performed on a specific type of product sold by the chain: apples. Based on their characteristics, the apples will be classified by quality to determine which types could generate the most sales.

Finally, the evolution of profits over time will be examined and a simple model will be built to predict this trend, helping to assess whether the company's revenue is increasing, stable, or decreasing.
